# Education and Career Success Data Analysis

This project explores the relationships between education, skills, and early career outcomes using a synthetic dataset. It covers the entire **data analysis pipeline**, from data cleaning and exploration to visualization and machine learning modeling.

## Key Components

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Handling duplicates, renaming columns, and preparing features for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Statistical summaries, pie charts, box plots, bar plots, and correlation analysis to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib and Seaborn plots for understanding distributions and relationships in the data.
- **Regression Modeling**: Comparison of Linear and Polynomial Regression models to predict starting salary, including model evaluation.
- **Reporting & Interpretation**: Clear documentation, results discussion, and lessons learnedâ€”especially around the challenges of working with synthetic or low-correlation data.

## How to Use

- Open `your_notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
- All code cells are annotated for easy navigation.
- Results tables and visualizations are available throughout.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tabulate
